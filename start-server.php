/**
 * Create the server class, each of the layers provide part of the request
 * process, the following has been extracted from the documentation for quick
 * reference:
 * 
 * 1) IoServer
 *    The IoServer should be the base of your application. This is the
 *    core of the events driven from client actions. It handles receiving
 *    new connections, reading/writing to those connections, closing the
 *    connections, and handles all errors from your application.
 * 
 *    @see http://socketo.me/docs/server
 *    
 * 2) HttpServer
 *    This component is responsible for parsing incoming HTTP requests.
 *    It's purpose is to buffer data until it receives a full HTTP header
 *    request and pass it on. You can use this as a raw HTTP server (not
 *    advised) but it's meant for upgrading WebSocket requests.
 * 
 *    @see http://socketo.me/docs/http
 * 
 * 3) WsServer
 *    This component allows your server to communicate with web browsers
 *    that use the W3C WebSocket API
 * 
 *    @see http://socketo.me/docs/websocket
 * 
 * Finally we end up at the class that is implemented in this project; class Game.
 * It implements the MessageComponentInterface so is required to provide an implementation
 * for onOpen, onClose, onMessage and onError methods.
